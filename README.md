</p>
<p>
When you configure roles, you define specific permissions and access levels for different users or system components. This ensures that each role has the appropriate privileges to perform assigned tasks while maintaining security and operational control. See the steps in the video demonstration link above.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure Departments</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
When configuring departments, you set up organizational units within the system, assigning specific responsibilities, workflows, and access controls to ensure that tickets or tasks are routed to the appropriate teams for efficient handling and management. See the steps in the video demonstration link above.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure Teams</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
When you configure teams, you group users across different departments based on expertise or responsibilities, allowing for better collaboration, ticket assignment, and workload distribution within the system. See the steps in the video demonstration link above.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure Agents</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>When you configure agents, you create individual user accounts for support staff, assigning them specific roles, permissions, and department access within the system. This ensures that agents can manage tickets, communicate with users, resolve issues, and perform administrative tasks based on their designated responsibilities. Proper agent configuration helps streamline workflow, enforce security policies, and ensure efficient ticket handling within the support system. See the steps in the video demonstration link above.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure Users</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
When you configure users, you create and manage customer accounts within the system, allowing them to submit tickets, track requests, and communicate with support agents while defining access levels and permissions to ensure efficient service management. See the steps in the video demonstration link above.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure SLA</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
When you configure SLA (Service Level Agreement), you define response and resolution time policies for support tickets, ensuring timely service delivery, prioritization, and compliance with customer expectations. See the steps in the video demonstration link above.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Configure Help Topics</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
When you configure help topics, you create predefined categories for support requests, allowing users to select the most relevant topic when submitting a ticket. This helps streamline ticket routing, assign requests to the appropriate departments or agents, and improve overall support efficiency. See the steps in the video demonstration link above.
